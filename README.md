## Description

Express MVC Setup is a command-line tool that helps you scaffold a basic MVC structure for your Express.js applications. It allows you to quickly set up the necessary directories and files for organizing your application code, promoting best practices in project structure.

## Features

- Interactive CLI for choosing your programming language (JavaScript or TypeScript).
- Automatically creates a structured directory for your Express application.
- Configurable base path for the application structure.

## Installation

To install the package globally, run:

```bash
npm install -g express-mvc-setup
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the CLI tool from the command line:

```bash
express-mvc-setup [base-path]
```

- **base-path**: (Optional) Specify the path where you want to create the MVC structure. If not provided, it defaults to the current working directory.

### Example

```bash
express-mvc-setup my-express-app
```

This command will create a new directory named `my-express-app` with the necessary files and structure.
